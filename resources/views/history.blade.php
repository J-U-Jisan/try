        TRY, a volunteer organization made by KUETians with an indomitable desire and mentality
        to stand beside people.
        </p>
        <p>TRY was officially reveal at the starting of 2014 in an attempt
        to do something for the people.
        </p>
        <p>
        The main purpose of TRY is to make people smile by standing beside them. It started
        with the KUETians and the people around the KUET, but now TRY is working all over the
        country. Providing winter clothes, providing blankets to helpless people by cycling,
        Iftar programs during Ramadan, funding for the treatment of sick KUETians is the permanent
        projects of TRY. Besides this, temporary projects are given scholarships to poor but
        talented students, standing beside helpless people and supporting them & also help to
        flood victim area.
        </p>
        <p>
        In this path of TRY, we always got the KUETians by our side. The Hall Collection,
        a grant from the KUET Alumni, and a small portion of the Student's Hall Dues are
        the source of TRY's donation. TRY is working for humanity only in search of an
        innocent smile. By embracing the dignity and humanitarian motivation of this faith,
        each member of the TRY has been working for a lifetime.
